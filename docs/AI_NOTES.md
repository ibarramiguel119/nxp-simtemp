## Prompts Used
This section list the main prompts used during the develoment:

### Initial prompt 
Write a minimal Linux kernel module for a simulated temperature sensor called nxp_simtemp.
Requirements for Step 1 (minimal):

Create a platform driver.
Create a test platform device so probe() runs even without Device Tree.
Register a misc character device named /dev/simtemp.
Implement read() so that each call returns a single binary record with the following struct:
struct simtemp_sample {
    __u64 timestamp_ns;
    __s32 temp_mC;
    __u32 flags;
} __attribute__((packed));
Flags:
    bit0 = NEW_SAMPLE
    bit1 = THRESHOLD_CROSSED
No timers, ring buffers, or poll() yet — each read generates a fresh sample with simulated temperature.
Provide proper probe() and remove() functions.
Include module init/exit and all necessary headers."

### Add functionality using a timer
Add functionality using a timer/hrtimer/workqueue to generate periodic samples. Currently, the sample is only generated on demand (via read()), not every N ms.


## Validation of results 

### Initial prompt 
-- **Code review**: Verified that the generated code contains the required logic, built successfully, and fixed issues reported in the build output.I use the command  sudo insmod nxp_simtemp.ko to upload the module and run with the cat /dev/simtemp | hexdump -C to the ouputs.

### Add functionality using a timer
--**load the module**  with sudo insmod nxp_simtemp.ko
--**verify the content** with  watch -n 1  dd if=/dev/simtemp bs=16 count=5 | hexdump -C and see the command shows updated timestamps and slightly different temperatures, confirming that periodic sampling via hrtimer is working correctly.
